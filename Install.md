# Install List
The following is guide to installing all the necessary components in order to be able to successfully run the hyper drive respository

### ROS
The first necessary component in running the hyper drive repository is the installation of the Robot Operating Software (ROS), specifically ROS Noetic. 
The guide for this can be found here: http://wiki.ros.org/noetic/Installation/Ubuntu

The next step would be to create a catkin workspace within ROS which can be done by following the instructions here: http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/Tutorials/create_a_workspace

### GitHub SSH Key
The next step would be to create a SSH key to connect the repository to your catkin workspace, which can be done following the instructions here: https://jdblischak.github.io/2014-09-18-chicago/novice/git/05-sshkeys.html#:~:text=Login%20to%20github.com%20and,hit%20Add%20key%20to%20save.

### Cloning and forking the hyper drive repository
You can now clone and fork the hyper drive repository following the instructions here: https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/adding-and-cloning-repositories/cloning-and-forking-repositories-from-github-desktop

### Future Usage
Now you should have been able to succesfully download ROS, connected to GitHub with the SSH key, and clone/fork the hyper drive repository. For further usage of the
hyper drive repository please refer to the README.md found in the main branch.
